<p><h4>The history of climate change began in the early 19th century when ice ages and 
other natural changes in paleoclimate were first suspected and the natural greenhouse 
effect was first identified.
</p>

<p>Climate change is that the long-term alteration in Earth’s climate and weather patterns. It took nearly 
a century of research and data to convince the overwhelming majority of the scientific community that act 
could alter the climate of our entire planet. In the 1800s, experiments suggesting that human-produced CO2 (CO2) 
and other gases could collect within the atmosphere and insulate Earth were met with more curiosity than concern. 
By the late 1950s, CO2 readings would offer a number of the primary data to corroborate the worldwide warming theory. 
Eventually an abundance of knowledge, along-side climate modeling would show not only that heating was real, but that 
it also presented a number of dire consequences.</h4></p>

<p><h4><font face="Arial">In 2015, United Nations General Assembly set up Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve a better sustainable future. 
It contains of 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Under those SDG’s, there is a goal to reduce climate change and to protect the 
environment as well. It is 13 th goal <font style=color:blue>“Climate Action”.</font></font></p>

<center><img src="climate_action.png" width="50%" height="50%"></center>

<p>Sustainable Development Goal 13 is about climate action and is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015. 
The official mission statement of this goal is to "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts". SDG 13 has targets which are to be achieved by 2030.</p>

<p>There are 5 targets of this SDG in total, all of which cover a wide range of issues surrounding climate action. The first three targets are "output targets": Strengthen resilience 
and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters; integrate climate change measures into policies and planning; build knowledge and capacity to meet climate change. 
The remaining two targets are "means of achieving" targets: To implement the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and to promote mechanisms to raise capacity for planning and management.
The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.</p>

<p>The decade between 2010 - 2019 was the warmest decade recorded in history. Currently climate change is affecting the global community in every nation across the world. 
The impact of climate change not only impacts national economies, but also lives and livelihoods, especially those in vulnerable conditions. By 2018, climate change continued 
exacerbating the frequency of natural disasters, such as massive wildfires, droughts, hurricanes and floods. Over the period 2000–2018, the greenhouse emissions of developed 
countries in transitions have declined by 6.5%. However, the emissions of the developing countries are up by 43% in the period between 2000 and 2013. In 2019, at least 120 of 153 developing 
countries had undertaken activities to formulate and implement national adaptation plans.</p></h4>

<p><h4 style="color:grey;">Following the SDG "Climate Change", there were major Agreements & Conferences to succeed the targets of SDG "Climate Change".
Here are them.......</h4></p>
