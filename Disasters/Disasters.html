<p>Climate change affects global temperature and precipitation patterns. These effects, in turn, influence the intensity and, in some cases, the frequency of
   extreme environmental events, such as forest fires, hurricanes, heat waves, floods, droughts, and storms.With increasing global surface temperatures the 
   possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur. As more water vapor is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes fuel for
    more powerful storms to develop. More heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean surface temperatures can lead to increased wind speeds in tropical storms.
     Rising sea levels expose higher locations not usually subjected to the power of the sea and to the erosive forces of waves and currents.</p><br/><br/>

<p><h3>Climate change has been a key factor in increasing the risk and extent of wildfires in the Western United States. Wildfire risk depends on a number
   of factors, including temperature, soil moisture, and the presence of trees, shrubs, and other potential fuel. All these factors have strong direct or 
   indirect ties to climate variability and climate change. Climate change enhances the drying of organic matter in forests (the material that burns and
    spreads wildfire), and has doubled the number of large fires between 1984 and 2015 in the western United States.
  Research shows that changes in climate create warmer, drier conditions. Increased drought, and a longer fire season are boosting these increases in wildfire risk. 
  For much of the U.S. West, projections show that an average annual 1 degree C temperature increase would increase the median burned area per year as much as 600 
  percent in some types of forests. In the Southeastern United States modeling suggests increased fire risk and a longer fire season, with at least a 30 percent
   increase from 2011 in the area burned by lightning-ignited wildfire by 2060.
  Once a fire starts—more than 80 percent of U.S. wildfires are caused by people—warmer temperatures and drier conditions can help fires spread and make 
  them harder to put out. Warmer, drier conditions also contribute to the spread of the mountain pine beetle and other insects that can weaken or kill trees,
   building up the fuels in a forest.
  Land use and forest management also affect wildfire risk. Changes in climate add to these factors and are expected to continue to increase the area 
  affected by wildfires in the United States.</h3> </p>
