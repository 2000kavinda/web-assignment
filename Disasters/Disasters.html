<p>Climate change affects global temperature and precipitation patterns. These effects, in turn, influence the intensity and, in some cases, the frequency of
   extreme environmental events, such as forest fires, hurricanes, heat waves, floods, droughts, and storms.With increasing global surface temperatures the 
   possibility of more droughts and increased intensity of storms will likely occur. As more water vapor is evaporated into the atmosphere it becomes fuel for
    more powerful storms to develop. More heat in the atmosphere and warmer ocean surface temperatures can lead to increased wind speeds in tropical storms.
     Rising sea levels expose higher locations not usually subjected to the power of the sea and to the erosive forces of waves and currents.</p><br/><br/>
