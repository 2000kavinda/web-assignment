            <p>Climate changes will, and already are, affecting every aspect of the hydrologic cycle.
                 Actions are needed to improve our understanding of water-related risks from climate change and to explore and implement strategies to reduce these risks. 
                 The Pacific Institute works to quantify climate changeâ€™s impacts on water systems and resources, cooperating with diverse stakeholders to identify 
                 and develop solutions that promote more resilient water systems in the U.S. and abroad.
                 It is not too late to act to slow the rate of climate change and to reduce the ultimate cost to public health, ecosystems, and the economy. </p>
