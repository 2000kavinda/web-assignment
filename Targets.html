            <p>Climate changes are already affecting every aspect of the world hydrolic cycle. Some actions need to be taken to develop 
                our understanding of all risks relating climate changes as well as to reduce these risks to avoid future disasters and dangers. 
                In most countries climate changes are a huge risk. To avoid risks they are already making people aware of the danger that comes as 
                a side effect of climate changes. Human effecfs such as pollution, high fuel consumption and harmfull chemicals can cause major 
                changes to the climate. Targets undertaken by the government and authorities are listed down below and future targets are beign
