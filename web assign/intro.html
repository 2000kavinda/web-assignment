<p>Though count of people who affect from poverty was reduced by it’s half during 1990 – 2015 period, still there are 736 millions of people who don’t have even food, 
clean water and sanitary facilities.Countries like India and China have decreased the poverty by their faster development. But it’s progress is not equally spread around the world. 
SDGs are a bold commitment to end what we started and to end poverty by 2030 in all its forms and dimensions. This includes increasing basic resources and services that are most 
vulnerable, and assisting communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters.</p>

<p>The number of people suffering from malnutrition has dropped by almost half in the last two decades due to rapid economic growth and increasing agricultural productivity. 
Central and East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean have all made great strides in eradicating hunger. It is estimated that by 2017, 821 million people will be suffering from 
chronic malnutrition, often as a direct result of environmental degradation, drought and loss of biodiversity. SDGs aims to end all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, 
ensuring that all people - especially children - have access to adequate and nutritious food throughout the year. This includes sustainable agricultural promotion, assistance to 
small farmers and a similar approach to land, technology and markets. International cooperation is also needed to ensure investment in infrastructure and technology to increase 
agricultural productivity.</p>

<p>Life expectancy has increased dramatically; Infant and maternal mortality rates have dropped, and we've been living with HIV. And malaria deaths have been halved. 
Good health is essential for sustainable development and the 2030 Agenda reflects the complexity and interrelationship between the two. It addresses growing economic and social 
inequalities, rapid urbanization, threats to climate and the environment, the continuing burden of HIV and other infectious diseases, and emerging challenges such as noncommunicable 
diseases. Universal health coverage is essential to achieving SDG 3, ending poverty and reducing inequality. Progress has been unequal between and within countries. There is a gap of 
31 years between the countries with the shortest and longest life expectancy.</p>

<p>Since 2000, there has been tremendous progress in achieving the goal of universal primary education. The total enrollment rate in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, 
and the number of out-of-school children worldwide has dropped by almost half. There has also been a huge increase in literacy rates, with more girls going to school than ever before. 
These are all outstanding successes. Progress has also intensified in some developing regions due to high levels of poverty, armed conflict and other emergencies. In West Asia and 
North Africa, the number of out-of-school children has risen due to the ongoing armed conflict. The goal is to ensure that all girls and boys complete free primary and secondary 
schooling by 2030. It also aims to provide equal access to affordable vocational training, eliminate gender and wealth inequality, and universal access to quality higher education.</p>

<p>The aim is end all discrimination against women and girls. Empowerment of women and girls has been shown to contribute to economic growth and development. But while there are more 
women in the labor market than ever before, there are still huge inequalities in some regions, with women systematically being denied the same service rights as men. Sexual violence 
and exploitation, unpaid care and unequal distribution of domestic service and discrimination in government offices all remain major obstacles. Climate change and disaster are having a 
disproportionate impact on women and children, as are conflicts and migration. It is important that women have equal rights to land and property, sexual and reproductive health and 
technology and the Internet.</p>

<p>Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent of the population, and is alarming as temperatures rise. It is predicted that by 2050, at least one in four people will experience repeated 
water shortages.By 2030, there is a need to invest in adequate infrastructure for safe and affordable drinking water, to provide sanitation and to encourage sanitation. Protecting and 
restoring water-based ecosystems is essential.</p>

<p>Between 2000 and 2016, the number of people without electricity increased from 78 to 87 percent, and the number without electricity was just under a billion. But as the population 
continues to grow, so will the demand for cheap energy, and a fossil fuel-dependent economy will make a drastic difference in our climate. Achieving SDG 7 by 2030 is critical to 
investing in solar, wind and thermal power, improving energy productivity and ensuring energy for all.</p>

<p>In developing countries, the middle class now accounts for more than 34 percent of total employment - a figure that tripled between 1991 and 2015. However, as the global economy 
continues to recover, we see slower growth, wider Inequalities and the lack of enough jobs to keep up with the growing workforce. SDGs promote sustainable economic growth, high 
productivity and technological innovation. Encouraging entrepreneurship and job creation are key to this and are effective measures to eradicate forced labor, slavery and human 
trafficking. The goal is to achieve full and productive employment and good employment for all women and men by 2030.</p>

<p>Investing in infrastructure and innovation are crucial drivers of economic growth and development. With more than half of the world's population now living in cities, mass 
transportation and renewable energy, as well as the growth of new industries and information and communication technologies, are becoming more and more important. Technological 
progress is also key. Promoting sustainable industries and investing in scientific research and innovation are important ways to facilitate sustainable development.</p>

<p>Income inequality has increased almost everywhere in recent decades, but at different speeds. It is the lowest in Europe and the highest in the Middle East.These widening 
disparities require good policies to empower low-income earners, and promote economic inclusion of all, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity. These include improving the 
regulation and oversight of financial markets and institutions, developing aid to areas with high demand, and encouraging foreign direct investment.</p>

<p>By 2050, two-thirds of the world's population - 6.5 billion people - will be urban.
The rapid growth of cities - a result of rising population and migration - has led to the boom, especially in the developing world, and slums are becoming an increasingly important 
part of urban life. Urban sustainability is about creating professional and business opportunities, building secure and affordable housing, and building resilient societies and economies. 
It includes investing in public transportation, creating green public spaces, and improving urban planning and management through participatory and inclusive routes.

<p>Agriculture is the largest user of water worldwide, and irrigation now accounts for nearly 70 percent of all freshwater use for human consumption. Efficient management of our shared 
natural resources and how we dispose of toxic waste and pollutants are important goals in achieving this goal. It is important to encourage industry, business and consumers to recycle 
and reduce pollution. A large portion of the world's population still consumes so little that their basic needs cannot be met.</p>
